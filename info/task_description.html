    Our robots are constantly building their skills in linguistics.
    For this they are researching the latin alphabet.
</p>

<p>
    The alphabet contains vowel and consonant letters (Yes, we divide the letters).<br>
    The vowels -- <strong>A E I O U Y</strong><br>
    The consonants -- <strong>B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text with different words. The words are separated by whitespaces and punctuation marks.
    Numbers are not words (a mix of letters and digits is not a word too).
    You should to count the words (striped words), where the vowels with consonants are alternated.
    That is, in counted words can not be two consecutive vowels or consonants.
    The words of a single letter are not striped -- don't count it. Case is not significant.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text. A string (unicode)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A quantity of striped words. An integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio("My name is ...") == 3
checkio("Hello world") == 0
checkio("A quantity of striped words.") == 1, "Only of"
checkio("Dog,cat,mouse,bird.Human.") == 3</pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    It can be useful for different linguistic researches.
